# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## A.DEFINING THE PROJECT 

**Customer:** Tech-Solution

**Project Name:** Fire Detection using Computer Vision

**Team Members**
- Nurâ€™Ain Najiha binti Zakaria (Project Manager)
- Nur Izzati binti Shafie
- Megala d/o Sontulom

**Objectives**
- To detect fire by using the computer vision technology that will alert people by
early detection of fire.
- To protect human lives, material assets and the environment from the dangers
and the effect of fire.
- To detect fire with a different approach rather than using an existing system.

1. Project Manager - Nur'Ain Najiha

A project manager is a person with the overall responsibility to initiate,
plan, design, execute, monitor, control and close a project successfully.
The project manager will plan and create the project schedule for the
stakeholders and ensure that each phase is implemented,troubleshooting, 
budget preparation and the process is controlled. The project manager must have 
the skills to ask pervasive questions, detect unintended assumptions and 
resolve disputes, and also more general management skills.

2. System Designer - Megala a/p Sontulom

The role of the system designer is to develop a comprehensive plan and
guidance that can be provided to the programmers. The main input
document used by the system designer is the specification of
specifications which the system or business analyst that has created. The
system designer is also responsible for drafting test schedules and
working with a team of users and system testers to ensure that the system
is properly tested.

3. Programmer - Nur Izzati

The task of the programmer is to define, develop, install and evaluate a
software framework that has designed an algorithm and a system using
a convolutionary neural network. When the final development
environment has been delivered to the programmer, it can also help
maintain and update the software and ensure that the security
vulnerabilities are solved and that it operates with new databases.
Programmer will build features that allow users to execute simple tasks
on a smartphone or computer, while others will develop underlying
systems that control networks.
